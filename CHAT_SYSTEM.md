4. Select message type (General/Completion/Pending Review)
5. Type message and click "Send"
6. Message is sent to student and appears in their notifications

### Student Flow
1. Login and view home page
2. Check "Notifications" section in right column

## Message Types

### General

- Icon: MessageCircle
- Color: Standard theme colors
- Use Case: Questions, feedback, general updates

### Completion
- Purpose: Notify task completion
- Icon: CheckCircle (suggested)

- Use Case: "Your assignment has been graded", "Project approved"

### Pending Review
- Purpose: Remind about pending items
- Icon: Clock (suggested)
- Color: Orange/Yellow accent

## Database Setup

### Required Tables
- `communication_message` - Stores all messages

### Sample Data
```python
# Create test message (Django shell)
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from apps.communication.models import Message

User = get_user_model()
mentor = User.objects.get(email='mentor@test.com')
student = User.objects.get(email='student@test.com')

Message.objects.create(
    sender=mentor,
    recipient=student,
    message_type='completion',
    content='Great work on your CLT submission!'
)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Implement WebSocket for instant message delivery
   - Push notifications

2. **Message History**
   - View all past messages
   - Search and filter messages

3. **Rich Text Support**
   - Markdown formatting
   - Attachments and links

4. **Two-way Communication**
   - Allow students to reply to mentors
   - Chat threads

5. **Read Receipts**
   - Show when message was read
   - Delivery confirmation

6. **Bulk Messaging**
   - Send messages to multiple students
   - Broadcast announcements

## Troubleshooting

### Messages not appearing
1. Check if backend server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Verify migrations are applied: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify auth token is valid in localStorage

### API Errors
1. Ensure communication app is in INSTALLED_APPS
2. Check CORS settings allow frontend origin
3. Verify database connection in backend
4. Check authentication middleware

### Frontend Issues
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check messageService.js has correct API_BASE_URL
3. Verify axios is installed: `npm list axios`
4. Check React components are imported correctly

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Login as mentor (mentor@test.com/mentor123)
2. Go to Student List
3. Select a student
4. Send a test message
5. Logout and login as student (student@test.com/student123)
6. Check home page notifications

### API Testing (curl)
```bash
# Get token
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mentor@test.com","password":"mentor123"}'

# Send message
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/communication/messages/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"recipient":1,"content":"Test message","message_type":"general"}'
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Only mentors can send messages
2. **Access Control**: Users can only see their own messages
3. **Input Validation**: Message content is sanitized
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens required for all endpoints
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing to prevent spam

## Performance

- **Database Indexing**: Created indexes on recipient+created_at and sender+created_at
- **Polling Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Query Optimization**: Only fetch unread messages for students
- **Pagination**: Can be added for message lists (future)

## Notes

- Backend database migrations created but may need to be applied depending on your database setup
- Frontend gracefully falls back to mock data if API is unavailable
- Message polling can be adjusted in Home.jsx (currently 30 seconds)
- Consider implementing WebSocket for production use instead of polling
